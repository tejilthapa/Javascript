Java script was made by Brendan Eich in 1995 in 10 days. The former name of javascript was mocha
the registered name of javascript is ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) script. 
JS was first time used as backhand in 2008 in nodeJS.
JS is a client side (fronthand) and server side (backhand) scripting language. 
JS is Dynamic and lightweighted language which is why we connect it in html at the bottom of the code.
JS became popular in June 2015 when its biggest update ES6(ver.6) was launched.
JS has datatype Number ,String and Boolean.

28, March, 2025 :-

Data types :-

(i) Primitive Datatypes :
	Number - Integer & Floating-point Numbers.
	Boolean - True or False.
	String - A sequence of alphanumeric characters.

(ii) Composite Datatypes (or Complex Datatypes) :
	Object - A named collection of data.
	Array - A sequence of values (an array is actually a predefined object).

(iii) Special Datatypes :
	Null - The only value is "null" -- to represent nothing.
	Undefined : The only Value is "undefined" -- to represent an uninitialized variable.

*Operator ->typeof - This is the Operator which tell the user the name of the datatype in the console.
			Syntax - console.log(typeof("name of variable"))

Type Conversion (Type Coercion) :
	The next variable gets convert to the same as the first variable.

	The first priority goes to string.
	The second priority goes to number.
	The Third priority goes to boolean.

Special characters are called Operators. they are used to perform task consisting of Special symbols

Uniary Operator -> ++, --. this works on a single value
Binary Operator -> Arthematic(+,-,*,/,%), Assignment(=,+=,-=,/=), Relational(>,<,>=,<=,==,===,!=), logical(&&,!,||).
Ternary Operator -> ?true:false

parseInt is used to convert the stirng taken in prompt into integar.

(Day 6)

Type of Loops:-

do while
while
for

For Nested loop :
Every time the condition of outer loop is true the inner loops starts from the starting again and again

Array - collection of multiple type of data is called array.
It is denoted by [] brackets.
This is ordered because due to indexing and is started by 0.
It is used to store multiple data in a single variable.
Index is the position of the element or the address of the value.

23, June, 2025:-


Push() fn -> it is used to add latest value in the end of the array.
Pop() fn -> it is used to remove the last index from the array.
Unshift() fn -> shifts the selected index to the front in array.
Shift() fn -> Removes the very first index from the array
Slice() fn -> takes out a element of the selected index from the array.(where the no. is,the adjcent no.)
Splice() fn -> deletes the element in a starting to ending manner.


24, June, 2025:-

Object-> Object is used to store multiple type of elements, it is not ordered and it has no indexing, object is denoted by {}.
		 The Data that Fills up is in key value pair.the left side on the column is key and the right side is value, a single key can store multiple data,




25, June, 2025:-

Function
Pre-defined Function -> where the funciton is already there just need to called
user-defined Function -> wherer the function is created by the user as their desire

Type of user defined:-

1. without argument & no return value
2. with argument & not return value
3. with argument & with return value
4. without argument & with return value

Argument works as a input for the function.

when a value is reutrned it goes back to the function calling.
It can be either printed directly or store in a  variable to do operations later on



DOM - Document Object Module
